- 👋 Hi, I’m Rafal.
- 👀 I’m interested in optimizing and writing software, from scientific applications written in Java that you run in your terminal, to beautiful web applications styled and animated with the help of CSS and JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use React.js library. I have also decided to educate myself about cybersecurity - I have just started my BTL1 certification course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, but I have recently been thinking of incorporating one of the AI apis into my CL programs, is anyone interested?  : )
- 📫 How to reach me? For example via LinkedIn - here is my profile link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafal-kala-55827941/.
- ⚡ Fun fact: did you know that Steve Jobs dropped out of College because he saw no benefit in the conventional education system? Elon Musk believes that college is “basically for fun and to prove that you can do your chores, but they’re not for learning”. As a literally-last-semester-of-my-university-program drop-out student, whose now cured pathological shyness stopped from fighting for himself at the time - NEVER feel down about dropping out of, or even not being able to go to the university - because with the strength of resilience, determination, and unfettered passion you can reach your dreams too. Some people people take unexpected paths, forging their own destiny despite all difficulties. Some of the most successful people in the world suffered hardships and financial hardship, they confronted personal challenges, but they all had one thing in common: an unshakeable commitment to their aspirations.
